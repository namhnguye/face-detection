# Face Detection

Draws a rectangle around detected faces from a camera.

I used python and the OpenCV library.

You will need to **pip install opencv-python** in order to **import cv2**.
\
Then you can **python main.py** in the terminal to start the program.
\
Pressing **q** will stop the program. 
\
Make sure you have a camera for your computer.
